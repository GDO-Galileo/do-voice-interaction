# do-voice-interaction

The goal of this project is to provide a voice assistant to the Global Data Observatory capable of executing various display commands and supporting users during their presentation. 



This project offers a modular framework for a voice-enabled chat service. The [gdo_voicebot](https://github.com/dsi-icl/do-voice-interaction/tree/master/gdo_voicebot) directory contains the microservices architecture. You will find there the following services:
* [Dialog manager service](https://github.com/dsi-icl/do-voice-interaction/blob/master/gdo_voicebot/dialog_manager_service/README.md)
* [Speech-to-Text service](https://github.com/dsi-icl/do-voice-interaction/blob/master/gdo_voicebot/stt_service/README.md)
* [Voice assistant service](https://github.com/dsi-icl/do-voice-interaction/blob/master/gdo_voicebot/voice_assistant_service/README.md)
* [Text-to-Speech service](https://github.com/dsi-icl/do-voice-interaction/blob/master/gdo_voicebot/tts_service/README.md)
