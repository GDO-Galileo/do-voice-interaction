+ How is the screen selection managed when displaying a picture, graphic, etc. ?
+ How does the touchpad work in relation to the screens? Is there a specific setting?
+ The idea of the voice-enabled chat service would be to bring a technological complement by retaining the use of the touchpad for certain commands (such as moving around on a 3D map or changing perspective) ? Or should we consider completely replacing the use of the touchpad with the voice-enabled chat service ?
